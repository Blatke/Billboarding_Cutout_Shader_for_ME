# Billboarding Cutout Shader for ME
This is to let MaterialEditor show the Billboarding Cutout Shader's options on the tab.
With using this shader on an object, it will show silhouette of the Vector Z (or the normal direction) of the object and it always faces to the camera or your view.

## How to Install
Download the .zipmod file for the latest version on the [Release](https://github.com/Blatke/Billboarding_Cutout_Shader_for_ME/releases) page, then drag and drop it into your **/mods/** folder, or use KKManager to install it.

So, it will appear on your MaterialEditor tab with the shader name: Particles/Billboarding Cutout.
